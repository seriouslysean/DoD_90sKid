Dungeons of Dredmor: 90's Kid Skill Tree
================================

Are you a kid of the 90's? Do you remember Saturday mornings? Those were they days. By harnessing the power of Saturday morning cartoons, you lay the smack down on your enemies. Gnarly!

Level One: 2 Cool 4 School
You never saw the point in going to school... It didn't help that you locked yourself in the refridgerator to learn the arts of staying cool.
+2 hyperborean damage
+2 hyperborean resistance

Level Two: Are You Afraid of the Dark?
Staying up late has given you some power over the darkness, an affinity for fire and the ability to bore your enemies to sleep through bad storytelling.
+1 necromantic resistance
+1 aethereal resistance
+2 sight radius
+20% chance to cast "Afraid of the Dark" on hit (100% chance to cause blind, 5% chance to cause sleep)

Level Three: Pogs? Pogs!
Pogs! Pogs! Pogs! The wonderful collectables that are fun for all! Sadly they are now worthless but at least they hurt if you throw them at people hard enough.

+Each stack of "I Ain't Afraid of No Ghosts" provides +1 toxic, necromantic, acidic, putrefying, aethereal and existential resistance.
