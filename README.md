Dungeons of Dredmor: 90's Kid Skill Tree
================================

Are you a kid of the 90's? Do you remember Saturday mornings? Those were they days. By harnessing the power of Saturday morning cartoons, you lay the smack down on your enemies. Gnarly! _This mod adds a new skill tree using Saturday morning cartoons as inspiration along with a few new items._

### Level One: 2 Cool 4 School
You never saw the point in going to school... It didn't help that you locked yourself in the refridgerator to learn the arts of staying cool.
* +2 hyperborean damage
* +2 hyperborean resistance

###Level Two: Are You Afraid of the Dark?
Staying up late has given you some power over the darkness, an affinity for fire and the ability to bore your enemies to sleep through bad storytelling.

* +1 sight radius
* 10% chance to cast "Afraid of the Dark" on hit (+2 conflagratory damage, 100% chance to cause blind, 18% chance to cause sleep)

### Level Three: Pogs? Pogs!
Pogs! Pogs! Pogs! The wonderful collectables that are fun for all! Sadly they are now worthless but at least they hurt if you throw them at people hard enough.

Your mother always told you not to slouch while watching cartoons and for whatever reason, you actually listened. Due to your incredibly good posture, your back muscles have been meticulously trained and are as hard as a rock providing you with extra protection! It's almost as if you have your own personal turtle shell... Turtle power!
